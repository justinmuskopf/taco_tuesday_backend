# The Taco Tuesday API

### What is this Preposterous Project?
This started as a Google Sheets calculator, and ended up being a fully-functional, Spring Boot backend.
The Taco Tuesday API provides the employees of a small office in Texas with the ability to manage, track, create, and poll taco orders that they religiously place every Tuesday.

### ... Why?
I'll get back to you on that.
